## INTRODUCTION ##

The Inference Engine Console is a very basic but useful tool for easily testing rule bases while developing them.

It supports binding, though obviously an empty Hashtable is passed to Process(). The test binder should have a setup method that prefills the Hashtable with the business objects expected from the running system.

At startup it loads all the assemblies found in the same folder as NxBRE-IE-Console.exe and all the assemblies of the executing .NET framework: this allows your binder to use your assemblies (stored in the same folder as the console) and all .NET classes (Data, XML, etc...).

Any contribution to this sub-project is welcome!
