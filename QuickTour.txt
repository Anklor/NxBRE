If you want to get a feeling on how the Inference Engine runs: 
- start the console 
- open "discount_lab.ruleml" 
- list the facts in the working memory with Ctrl+L 
- run the query with F6, see how it returns nothing, 
- make the engine infer with F5 
- see the facts it deducts 
- list the facts in the WM again 
- run the query again 
 
You can then start playing with the WM: 
- re-open the "discount_lab.ruleml" rule base (Ctrl+O), 
- create a new isolated memory with Ctrl+I 
- infer with F5 
- Ctrl+L 
- roll back to to global WM Ctrl+G 
- Ctrl+L 
 
Redo this but this time commit to the global memory and see how the asserted facts are "copied" to the global WM. 
 
Another exercise consists in manually asserting/retracting facts the rule base can understand: 
- re-open the "discount_lab.ruleml" rule base, 
- process F5 
- process again : nothing is deducted 
- assert luxury{Ferrari} with Ctrl+A 
- process again and see how new deductions are made. 

This quick tour gives a first feeling on how the Inference Engine works & behaves.
